# How to Get Wolfram Alpha Pro Features for Free on Windows
 
Wolfram Alpha is a powerful computational knowledge engine that can answer almost any question you can think of. However, some of its most useful features, such as step-by-step solutions, data upload, and interactive visuals, are only available for Pro users who pay a monthly fee of $4.99.

But what if I told you that you can get these features for free using Wolfram's own services? In this article, I will show you how to use Wolfram Programming Cloud to access Wolfram Alpha Pro features for free on Windows. This method works for any query that you would normally enter into Wolfram Alpha, and it doesn't require any hacking or cracking.
 
## Step 1: Sign up for Wolfram Programming Cloud
 
The first step is to sign up for Wolfram Programming Cloud. This is a service that lets you create and run Wolfram Language code in the cloud. You can sign up for a free account here: [https://www.wolframcloud.com/](https://www.wolframcloud.com/).
 
After signing up, you will see a screen like this. Click on "Create a New Notebook".

## Step 2: Create a Wolfram Alpha Query
 
Once you have created a notebook, click on the "+" icon on the top left of the notebook and select "Wolfram Alpha Query".

This will create a cell where you can enter any query that you would normally enter into Wolfram Alpha. For example, let's say you want to solve a math problem and see the step-by-step solution. You can type something like this:

## Step 3: Run the Query and See the Results
 
To run the query, press Shift+Enter or click on the "Run" button on the top right of the cell. You will see the results below the cell, just like on Wolfram Alpha. However, unlike on Wolfram Alpha, you will also see a button that says "Step-by-step solution". If you click on it, you will see the detailed steps to solve the problem.

You can also use other Pro features, such as data upload, image input, file upload, interactive visuals, etc. Just enter the appropriate query and run it. You can also export the data or visuals to your computer by right-clicking on them and choosing "Save As".
 
## Conclusion
 
That's it! You have just learned how to get Wolfram Alpha Pro features for free on Windows using Wolfram Programming Cloud. This is a great way to use Wolfram Alpha without paying anything or breaking any rules. However, keep in mind that this method has some limitations:
 
- You need an internet connection to use Wolfram Programming Cloud.
- You have a limited amount of computation time and storage space with a free account.
- You may not be able to access some advanced Pro features that require special permissions or settings.

If you want to use Wolfram Alpha without these limitations, you may want to consider getting a Pro subscription. It's not very expensive and it supports the development of Wolfram Alpha as a resource for the world.
